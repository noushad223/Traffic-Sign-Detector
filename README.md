# Traffic-Sign-Detector
A Computer Vision project written in Google Colab that uses YOLOv8 (yolov8n) model to predict traffic signs. This dataset was compiled from kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/cardetection?resource=download-directory&amp;select=car. At the present moment I am only training and testing this model with minimal arguments and max 100 epochs.
